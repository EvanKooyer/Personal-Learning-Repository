# Personal-Learning-Repository
## Learning in the public
This repo is only here for me to embarrass myself and publicly show what I am learning and practicing. I figured it would be a great (foolish maybe?) way to display the current concepts and languages I am learning. If anything it might help me understand what I am writing better than just practicing in an online learning portal. There is no functional project here, just random notes and files that practice specific problems and concepts in specific languages. This will be a sandbox where I can dip my toes into something before I use it in a project.

## Python
I have learned a lot in the past year about coding in python. this will not be a 0-100 map of what I have learned about python more than it is adding things as I practice them.

## Zig... Maybe?
I have been looking into learning a more in depth language, and zig might be a place to start. Think I need to understand what i like and don't like on python first before diving into a different language.

## Algorithms, Data Structures, and Programming Paradigms.. oh my!
This will be the important section. I want to understand how problems are actually solved in coding and how different ideas are implemented.
